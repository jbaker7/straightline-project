# The Straight Line Project

A single page application built in React inspired by the Straight Line Missions made popular by the YouTube channel GeoWizard.

This application allows you to import a .gpx or .csv file containing a log of GPS coordinates and will then score the path based on how well it adheres to a perfectly straight line. Geographic calculations are done using the turf.js library.
